<h5>NSYNC fun facts</h5>
<p>NSYNC got its name after Justin Timberlake’s mother made a comment on how “in sync” the group’s singing voices were. The spelling/format of the name is also a play on the last letter of each of the initial members’ names: JustiN, ChriS, JoeY, JasoN, and JC.
  Shortly after the formation of that though, one of the singers, Jason Galasso, left the band. He was eventually replaced by singer Lance Bass. In order to keep the acronym going, Lance was nicknamed “Lanceton.”
</p>
<h5> Style Choices</h5>
<p> While Lance admired Justin's style when they first met, he also explained that there wasn't much guidance for the guys on their "look." When they arrived at concerts or on set, Lance explained, the guys were told to pick clothes from racks of random styles. And while most fans have seen the memes about Justin's Top Ramen hair, Lance started the bleached ends trend out of a necessity to spice up his hairstyle when a quick cut wasn't in the cards.</p>
