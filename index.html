<h5>NSYNC fun facts</h5>
<p>NSYNC got its name after Justin Timberlake’s mother made a comment on how “in sync” the group’s singing voices were. The spelling/format of the name is also a play on the last letter of each of the initial members’ names: JustiN, ChriS, JoeY, JasoN, and JC.
  Shortly after the formation of that though, one of the singers, Jason Galasso, left the band. He was eventually replaced by singer Lance Bass. In order to keep the acronym going, Lance was nicknamed “Lanceton.”
